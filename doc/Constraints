Which constraints have I been adding manually in fet?
Possibly just playing around with available times, number of gaps, etc.?


HH: Very hard
H: Hard
h: Hard, but can only be evaluated when all activities have been placed
    What should be the consequences of a failure? Continue shuffling?
S: Soft (only evaluated when all activities have been placed)

For manual placement it might be helpful to evaluate as many of the h
and S constraints as possible after each move, so that troublesome
activities can be moved.


Teachers:
    * Available/blocked periods
        # HH, S?
    * Lunch breaks
        # H, S
    * Min lessons per day
        # h, S
        (ConstraintTeacherMinHoursDaily)
    * Max lessons per day
        # H, S
        (ConstraintTeacherMaxHoursDaily?)
    * Max gaps per day? per week
        # h, S
        (ConstraintTeacherMaxGapsPerDay?)
        (ConstraintTeacherMaxGapsPerWeek)
    * Max block length (periods without break)
        # H, S
        (ConstraintTeacherMaxHoursContinuously)
    * Max days per week
        # H, S?
        (?)


Classes/groups (are constraints always relevant for whole classes,
or do some need to be restricted to groups?):
    * Available/blocked periods
        # HH, S?
    * Lunch breaks
        # H, S
    * Min lessons per day
        # h, S
        (ConstraintStudentsSetMinHoursDaily)
    * Max lessons per day?
        # H, S
    * Max gaps per day? per week?
        # h, S
        (?)
        (ConstraintStudentsSetMaxGapsPerWeek)


Activities:
    * At start/end of day
        # h (H for start?), S
        (?)
        (ConstraintActivityEndsStudentsDay)
    * Not on same day
        # H, S
    * Min days between (combine with not-on-same-day?)
        # H, S
        (ConstraintMinDaysBetweenActivities)
    * Not after (with or without intervening periods?)
        # H, S
        (ConstraintTwoActivitiesOrderedIfSameDay)
    * Not consecutive (ConstraintMinGapsBetweenActivities)


From fet, here probably implemented some other way:
    *** ConstraintStudentsSetNotAvailableTimes
    *** ConstraintTeacherNotAvailableTimes
    *** ConstraintActivityPreferredStartingTime(s)
    *** ConstraintActivitiesPreferredStartingTimes (double lesson start times)
    *** ConstraintActivitiesSameStartingTime
    *** ConstraintActivityPreferredRoom(s)
