Support functions for table-grids using the QGraphicsView framework.

* Manage allocation of style resources, using caches.
* Provide a grid-based rectangle for use as a selection marker.

=-LICENCE========================================

The coordinate system is such that rectangle borders are roughly
centred on the given coordinates. Regard a coordinate as a line without
width before the pixel which is actually drawn.
Given a coordinate x = 5:
    border = 1 => pixel 5
    border = 2 => pixels 4/5
    border = 3 => pixels 4/5/6
If a grid is drawn (separately from the tiles), it might be necessary
to adjust the coordinates of the tile so as not to paint over the grid.
Alternatively, putting the grid lines on top might be an easier solution.

"When rendering with a pen with an even number of pixels, the pixels will
be rendered symmetrically around the mathematically defined points, while
rendering with a pen with an odd number of pixels, the spare pixel will
be rendered to the right and below the mathematical point.
"

The grid area can be covered by boxes of predefined width and height.
I would suggest an optional box border of fixed width (but what does
"fixed width" mean here, e.g fixed pixels or fixed points/mm? As I am
aiming for a point/mm based specification, I would suggest the latter).
If there is no border there will be an empty gap â€“ thus making the
geometry independent of the border. That would mean that "no border"
would need a transparent pen.
