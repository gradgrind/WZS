# awkward clashes, like teachers, groups, fixed rooms. Also other
# constraints might be at least threatened, but it might be difficult to
# test these for conflicts.
# There could be some sort of activity-group for checking that all the
# parallel activities can be placed before any one of them is actually
# placed. One possibility might be combined teacher, group and room
# lists like for blocks. Alternatively there could be a tied-to field
# referring to another activity which is to be placed simultaneously
# (presumably only with "hard" weighting).


#*** ConstraintActivityPreferredRoom(s)
# Handled by the special room constraint functions.

#*** ConstraintStudentsSetNotAvailableTimes
#*** ConstraintTeacherNotAvailableTimes
# At present I am assuming that "hard" non-available slots contain -1.
#TODO: The soft version must be implemented as a constraint here.

#*** ConstraintActivityPreferredStartingTime(s)
# The version with a single fixed time and weight "+". is handled
# by the initial placement function.
#TODO: Is this constraint also available in a "soft" form?
# My gui doesn't at present provide for a weighting of this constraint.
# When might it make sense?

#TODO:?
#*** ConstraintActivitiesPreferredStartingTimes (e.g. double lesson start times)
# This could be done using multiple single-activity constraints and it
# is not clear that a multiple-activity constraint would help much.
