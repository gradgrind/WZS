### -----

# Should the group date (divisions, grous, students) be stored as part
# of the class data, or as a separate entity? How much is transferable
# from year to year? Perhaps store the groups, with student references
# in a GROUPS table? Even though the groups would only be relevant as
# part of a class, having a separate table for them can help avoiding
# deep JSON trees.

# The data available for a student can vary according to the source.
# How the data is used will determine which fields are necessary (e.g.
# what student data a particular report type needs). Their values are
# strings, but the details may depend on the locality, etc. Dates are
# in ISO-format.
# Certain fields should always be present, though in some cases the
# value may be empty. For the moment I will define the compulsory fields
# to be:
#   ID: unique identifier for the student
#   LASTNAME: the family name, primary sort field
#   FIRSTNAMES: all first names
#   FIRSTNAME: the name by which the student is called, secondary sort field
#   GENDER: whatever is appropriate in the locality (e.g. m/w or m/w/d ...)
#   DATE_BIRTH: the day the student was born
#   BIRTHPLACE: town (perhaps also country)
#   DATE_ENTRY: the day the student was enrolled
#   DATE_EXIT: the day the student left the establishment
