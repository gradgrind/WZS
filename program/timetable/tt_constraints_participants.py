# Basically, I would just need to evaluate all (relevant?) constraints.
# Something like:
    #for c in constraints:
    #    p = c.evaluate()
    #    #? if p < 0: ... break
    #    penalty += p
# Of course, if I want to know the penalty due to placing a particular
# activity, I would need to restrict the evaluation to the constraints
# whose value changes. Or else see how the total changes ... (does the
# existence of hard constraints, or special high-penalty constraints
# affect this?)

# It should be possible to detect blocking lessons automatically so that
# the placement of a particular lesson can be forced. Perhaps not the
# room choices, though?

# Would inheritance from a base class <Constraint> help? Or is it
# enough to provide the <evaluate> method (to adhere to the "interface")?
